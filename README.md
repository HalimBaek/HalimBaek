🌿 **Hello, I’m Harim.**  

I majored in **Apparel and Fashion.**  
Now, I’m exploring the intersection of **data and AI**,  
blending technology with aesthetics in creative ways.  

I’m inspired by **clothes, music, and swimming**,  
and I believe in living each day with *passion, gratitude, and love* —  
doing my best and embracing life fully.
