## ðŸŒ¿ Hello, Iâ€™m Harim.

I majored in Apparel and Fashion.
Now, Iâ€™m exploring the intersection of data and AI, discovering new ways to blend technology with aesthetics.

Iâ€™m inspired by clothes, music, and swimming, and I believe in living each day with passion, gratitude, and love â€” doing my best and embracing life fully.
